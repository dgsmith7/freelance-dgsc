# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in this project, please report it by sending an email to [your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com). Please do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Management Process

1. We regularly run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities in our dependencies
2. Moderate and high severity issues are addressed promptly
3. We use package overrides when direct updates aren't available
4. Updates are tested thoroughly before deployment to ensure they don't break functionality

## Current Status

Last security audit: [Date of your most recent audit]

Status: [Current security status - e.g., "All known vulnerabilities addressed"]

## Third-party Libraries

We make use of several third-party libraries. While we make efforts to keep these updated, some vulnerabilities may exist in dependencies we don't control directly. We use package overrides and careful version pinning to manage these risks.

# Security Vulnerabilities - Risk Assessment

## Risks of Not Addressing npm Vulnerabilities

### Short-term Risks:

- **Security Exposure**: The vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited if they affect production code
- **CI/CD Pipeline Issues**: Many continuous integration systems will fail builds with known vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Drift**: As time passes, the gap between your versions and secure versions widens

### Medium-term Risks:

- **Compounding Vulnerabilities**: New vulnerabilities may build upon existing ones
- **Deployment Blockers**: Some deployment platforms (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) will flag deployments with vulnerabilities
- **Client Concerns**: Security-conscious clients may run their own audits and question the vulnerabilities

### Long-term Risks:

- **Technical Debt**: Eventually requires a more complex, potentially breaking upgrade
- **Potential Data Breaches**: In worst-case scenarios, vulnerabilities could lead to data exposure
- **Reputation Damage**: If a security incident occurs due to a known vulnerability

## Current Vulnerabilities Impact Assessment

The moderate vulnerabilities currently present likely affect:

1. **Development Dependencies**: Vulnerabilities in development tools generally pose less risk than runtime dependencies
2. **Nested Dependencies**: Issues in packages you don't directly import but are used by your dependencies
3. **Specific Attack Vectors**: Most npm vulnerabilities require specific conditions to be exploited

## Recommended Approach

While these moderate vulnerabilities may not pose an immediate threat, it's best practice to:

1. Address them systematically when practical
2. Document any accepted risks with clear rationales
3. Establish a regular cadence for security reviews
